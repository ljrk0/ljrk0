### Leo/Janis aka lj

Hi, I'm lj, a os/firmware dev, grown teacher, become pentester and now fed up with the consultancy world :-)

Most of my dev'ing is around tooling and contributing to projects I use/like or stumble upon.

 * Favorite editor: ~~vim, atom, neovim, kak, vi, vscode, vim, emacs~~ I gave up and use vi/vscode/emacs in rotation.
 * OS: fedora Silverblue and ArchLinux
 * Programming Languages: C (most skill), Rust (most awe), Haskell (most passion), Python (most hatred)
 * Interests: Typ~~o~~esetting (LaTeX, ConTeXt, Typst, roff, Markdown), Automation, Software Verification, Taint Analysis & Code Review, Immutable OS, FIDO & Passkeys, Reverse Engineering, Learning & Teaching, Cryptography, ...
 * Names & Pronouns: lj (they/them, any), Janis (she) or Leo (he)

My blog is over at https://www.blog.ljrk.org where I cover my bad and worse ideas.

I work at [intÂ³](https://intcube.io) where I do various things but one of our goals is to build a platform to help businesses to do better IT security decisions, 
leveraging our extensive in that field.
Why a platform? Because single consultants *don't scale*, cost a lot and often don't do good anyway.
